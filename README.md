Blinky
======

This program is used to Blink the surface mount LED on the Arduino Uno.

1) Blink.asm is to be compiled in an assembler such as AVRstudio4 which will generate a hex file. 
2) The hex file is then to be used to flash the ATmega328P using a terminal with avrdude installed. 
3) If the arduino is flashed correctly, the LED on board will begin to flash at a steady frequency.
